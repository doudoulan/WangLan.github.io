I am a staff at National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
My research interests are galaxy formation and evolution, including related models, simulations and observations. In recent years, my works mainly focus on topics of galaxy morphology and galactic bulges, both from simulation point of view and from observational statistics. 

Galaxy morphology 
======

[Wang et al. 2019c](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.2083W/abstract): comparing galaxy morphology in hydrodynamical simulation Illustris and in semi-analytic model.
By comparing in detail the growth histories of some matched galaxy pairs of Milky Way mass in Illustris and the SAM model, we notice two aspects of differences in determining galaxy morphology between the two galaxy formation implementations. First, in the SAM, major merger and frequent minor mergers result in the growth of bulges and turn the galaxy into ET, while bulge formation is not connected to mergers as tightly as in SAM for the Illustris galaxies. In addition, the satellite stellar mass can decrease significantly due to tidal stripping before merging into the central galaxy in Illustris, while it does not decrease in the SAM model. This results in less mergers with large (stellar) mass ratios in the Illustris simulation, and less effect of mergers on shaping galaxy morphology.

[Zeng, Wang & Gao 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.507.3301Z/abstract): formation of massive disc galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation.
We investigate the formation history of massive disc galaxies in hydrodynamical simulation ‚Äì the IllustrisTNG, to study why massive disc galaxies survive through cosmic time. We find that 8.4 per cent of these massive disc galaxies have quiet merger histories and preserve disc morphology since formed. 54.2 per cent have a significant increase in bulge components in history, then become discs again till present time. The rest 37.3 per cent experience prominent mergers but survive to remain discy. While mergers and even major mergers do not always turn disc galaxies into ellipticals, we study the relations between various properties of mergers and the morphology of merger remnants. We find a strong dependence of remnant morphology on the orbit type of major mergers. Specifically, major mergers with a spiral-in falling orbit mostly lead to disc-dominant remnants, and major mergers of head-on galaxy‚Äìgalaxy collision mostly form ellipticals. This dependence of remnant morphology on orbit type is much stronger than the dependence on cold gas fraction or orbital configuration of merger system as previously studied.

[Zeng, Wang et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240414184Z/abstract): Kinematic morphology of low-mass galaxies in IllustrisTNG.
The origin of diverse kinematic morphologies observed in low-mass galaxies is unclear. In this study, we investigate the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies with stellar mass 108.5‚àí9.0ùëÄ‚äô at ùëß = 0 in the TNG50-1 cosmological simulation. The majority of the low-mass galaxies in TNG50-1 are dispersion-dominated, consistent with observations. By tracing the evolutionary histories of simulated low-mass galaxies, we find that while most stars form in rotating cold gas discs, the orientation of the star-forming discs relative to the galaxies may evolve with cosmic time. If the cold gas disc remains aligning with the galaxy during its evolution, stars formed at different times share the same rotational direction, leading to a rotation-dominated system. On the contrary, frequent misalignment of cold gas disc would result in a dispersion-dominated system. In addition, we also find that the two-body scattering can have a non-negligible numerical heating effect on the simulated galaxy morphology, especially at central regions of galaxies and for relatively low-mass galaxies. By comparing results of simulations with different resolutions, our results suggest that the simulated morphology of galaxies is reliable when their number of stellar particles exceeds about
10,000, and bulge morphology of galaxies can not be resolved robustly at the resolution level of TNG50-1.

[Wang et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.2337W/abstract): HI content of massive red spiral galaxies observed by FAST.
We observe H I content of the rest 113 massive red spiral galaxies using the FAST telescope. 75 of the 113 galaxies have H I detection with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) greater than 4.7. Compared with the red spirals in the same sample that have been observed by the ALFALFA survey, galaxies observed by FAST have on average a higher S/N, and reach to a lower H I mass. To investigate why many red spirals contain a significant amount of HI mass, we check colour profiles of the massive red spirals using images observed by the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. We find that galaxies with H I detection have bluer outer discs than the galaxies without H I detection, for both ALFALFA and FAST samples. For galaxies with H I detection, there exists a clear correlation between galaxy H I mass and g-r colour at outer radius: galaxies with higher H I masses have bluer outer discs. The results indicate that optically selected massive red spirals are not fully quenched, and the H I gas observed in many of the galaxies may exist in their outer blue discs.

Galactic bulges
======

[Wang et al. 2019b](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.484.3865W/abstract): The clustering of galaxies with pseudo-bulge and classical bulge in the local Universe.
We investigate the clustering properties and close neighbour counts for galaxies with different
types of bulges and stellar masses. We find that neither the presence of a central bulge, nor the bulge type
is related to intermediate-to-large scale environments. On smaller scales, pseudo bulge  and pure-disc galaxies similarly show strong excess in close neighbour count when compared to control galaxies, at all masses probed. For classical bulges, small-scale excess is also observed but only for Mstars < 10^10 Msun. These results imply strong connections between galactic bulges and galaxy‚Äìgalaxy interactions in the local Universe, although it is unclear
how they are physically linked in the current theory of galaxy formation.

[Hu, Wang et al. 2024](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.529.4565H/abstract): Resolved properties of classical bulge and pseudo-bulge galaxies.
We compare properties of classical and pseudo-bulges and properties of their hosting galaxies selected from the MaNGA survey. Our results show that at given stellar mass, disc components of pseudo-bulge galaxies are younger, have more active star formation, rotate more, and may contain more H I content compared with those of classical bulge galaxies, and the differences are larger than those between bulges themselves. The correlations between bulge types and disc properties indicate that different types of bulges are shaped by different processes that may regulate both growth of central components and evolution of outer discs in galaxies.

Comparison and degenereacy of galaxy formation models
------
The current models of galaxy formation and evolution have achieved many successes. However, the detail descriptions on different physical processes still have a lot of uncertainties, and degeneracies exist among these processes in reproducing observational statistics of galaxies. For example, for semi-analytic galaxy formation models, modification to the star formation law has similar effect as increasing supernovae feedback, in suppressing star formation in low mass galaxies in low redshift to match observation. Even when the relations between galaxy stellar mass and its host dark matter halo mass in different models show the same median relation, how galaxies populate the scatters of the relation can result to different galaxy clustering properties, due to the detail dependence of galaxy stellar mass on halo formation time. Apart from the degeneracies of physical processes, cosmology also adds degeneracy in the picture of galaxy formation. Warm dark matter and cold dark matter cosmologies result to similar galaxy properties of many aspects that are difficult to be distinguished within current observational accuracy.

[Wang, Weinmann & Neistein 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.421.3450W/abstract): we explore modifications to the SF law as an alternative solution of very efficient supernova feedback in semi-analytic models, to achieve a match to the low-mass end of galaxy stellar mass function. Our best model includes lower SF efficiencies than predicted by the Kennicutt‚ÄìSchmidt law at low stellar masses, no sharp threshold of cold gas mass for SF and an SF law that is independent of cosmic time, and give a good match to the observed autocorrelation function of galaxies, an evolution of the stellar mass function from z = 3 to z = 0 similar to observations and better agreement with observed specific SF rates. 

[Wang, De Lucia & Weinmann 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.431..600W/abstract): on the scatter in the stellar mass - halo mass relation.
The detail of how galaxies populate the scatter in the stellar mass‚Äìhalo mass relation does play an important role in determining the correlation functions of galaxies. While the stellar mass of galaxies in the Wang et al. model depends only on halo mass and is randomly distributed within the scatter, galaxy stellar mass depends also on the halo formation time in semi-analytical models. At fixed value of infall mass, galaxies that have larger stellar mass reside in haloes that formed earlier. This effect is much stronger in Guo11 than in DLB07, which explains the overclustering of low mass galaxies in Guo11. Assembly bias in Guo11 model might be overly strong. Nevertheless, in case that a significant assembly bias indeed exists in the real Universe, one needs to use caution when applying current HOD and abundance matching models that employ the assumption of random scatter in the relation between stellar and halo mass.

[Wang et al. 2013](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.433..515W/abstract):Detection of galaxy assembly bias.
the influence of assembly bias on galaxy clustering is analysed using both semi-analytic galaxy formation models (SAMs) and observational data. At fixed stellar mass, SAMs predict that the clustering of central galaxies depends on the specific star formation rate, with more passive galaxies having a higher clustering amplitude. We find similar trends using the SDSS group catalogues. The clustering dependence on sSFR represent a direct detection of assembly bias. 

[Wang et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.468.4579W/abstract): The galaxy population in cold and warm dark matter cosmologies. 
We combine a pair of high-resolution N-body simulations implementing the standard cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony and a warm dark matter (WDM) alternative where the dark matter particle is a 1.5 keV thermal relic, with the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model to explore differences between the resulting galaxy populations. The only significant difference in the local universe we find is in the galaxy populations of ‚ÄòLocal Volumes‚Äô, regions of radius 1‚Äì8 Mpc around simulated Milky Way analogues. In such regions, our WDM model provides a better match to observed local galaxy number counts and is five times more likely than the CDM model to predict subregions within them that are as empty as the observed Local Void. Thus, a highly complete census of the Local Volume and future surveys of void regions could provide constraints on the nature of dark matter.

[Wang et al. 2019a](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482.4454W/abstract): Starburst galaxies in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation and evolution.
We study the shape and evolution of the star formation main sequence in three independently developed semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We focus, in particular, on the characterization of the model galaxies that are significantly above the main sequence, and that can be identified with galaxies classified as `starburst' in recent observational work. We find that, in all three models considered, star formation triggered by merger events (both minor and major) contribute to only a very small fraction of the cosmic density of star formation. While mergers are associated with bursts of star formation in all models, galaxies that experienced recent merger events are not necessarily significantly above the main sequence. On the other hand, `starburst galaxies' (defined as those with star formation rates larger than four times the typical value in the main sequence) are not necessarily associated with merger episodes, especially at the low-mass end. Galaxies that experienced recent mergers can have relatively low levels of star formation when/if the merger is gas-poor, and galaxies with no recent merger can experience episodes of starbursts due to a combination of large amount of cold gas available from cooling/accretion events and/or small disc radii which increases the cold gas surface density.

Models on statistical relations between galaxy and (sub)halo
-----
A methodology was developed that falls midway between the traditional semi-analytic approach and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) approach. In our models, the positions and velocities of the galaxies are predicted by following the orbits and merging histories of the substructures in simulation. Parametrized functions are modelled to relate galaxy properties to the halo mass at infall time. A series of works have been done based on this method.

- [Wang et al. 2006](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006MNRAS.371..537W/abstract): relations between the luminosities and the stellar masses of galaxies in the local Universe and their host halo masses are constrained, by fitting the luminosity function, the stellar mass function and the shape and amplitude of the two-point correlation function evaluated in different stellar mass and luminosity ranges in SDSS.

- [Wang et al. 2007](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007MNRAS.377.1419W/abstract): Modelling and interpreting the dependence of clustering on the spectral energy distributions of galaxies.
Star formtion histories of central and satellite galaxies are further modelled and constrained, by fitting the observed abundances and projected correlations of galaxies as a function of 4000-√Ö break strength/g-r color in the SDSS.
  
- [Wang & Jing 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.402.1796W/abstract): applied to redshift of around 0.8, the stellar mass - halo mass relation is constrained by fitting both the stellar mass function and the correlation functions at different stellar mass intervals of VVDS observations. A unified model of the stellar mass - halo mass relation as a function of time is also proposed, by fitting both SDSS and VVDS observations simultaneously.
  
- [Wang 2017 (in Chinese)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017SSPMA..47d9806W/abstract): a review on models that link galaxies with (sub)haloes, which study the relation between galaxy properties and (sub)halo properties in a statistical way. 



For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
